Metawear-UV
========================

Sample iOS App for MetaWear with a UV sensor attached (www.mbientlab.com)

Now you can use this project and keep out of the sun's harmful rays. This wearable let's you know when it is time to re-apply sunscreen.

## ATTENTION!
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for dependency management, this means you need to open **MetaWearApiTest.xcworkspace** and not MetaWearApiTest.xcodeproj.
